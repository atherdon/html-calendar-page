lets get the noonification telegram group off the ground. how hard is it to auto post in the group each time an article published on hackernoon.com/tagged/hackernoon-top-story?

---

Telegram channels created for Hacker Noon  - @hackernoonofficial and @noonification
https://t.me/durov message him about getting @hackernoon back. reserve @noonification @hackernoon.com and other channels

---

Telegram channel as a Bot. Something like this - https://telegram.me/vkm_bot. It asks for input, user enters something like top stories, javascript, blockchain etc and the bot shows them HN 10-12 stories.
